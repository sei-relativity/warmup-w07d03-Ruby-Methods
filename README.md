```

### starter

```ruby

def find_difference(s , t)
s = s.split("")
t = t.split("")
p t-s
end
find_difference("abcd", "baedc")

```

## Missing Number

Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

Example 2:

Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
```

### starter

```ruby

def missing_num(arr)

end

missing_num([3,0,1]) #2


missing_num([9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]) #8


```
